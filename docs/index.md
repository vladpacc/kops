# kops - Kubernetes Operations

[GoDoc]: https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kops
[GoDoc Widget]: https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kops?status.svg

The easiest way to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running.

## 2020-05-06 etcd-manager Certificate Expiration Advisory

kops versions released today contain a **critical fix** to etcd-manager: 1 year after creation (or first adopting etcd-manager), clusters will stop responding due to expiration of a TLS certificate. Upgrading kops to 1.15.3, 1.16.2, 1.17.0-beta.2, or 1.18.0-alpha.3 is highly recommended. Please see the [advisory](./advisories/etcd-manager-certificate-expiration.md) for the full details.

## What is kops?

We like to think of it as `kubectl` for clusters.

`kops` helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly
available, Kubernetes clusters from the command line. AWS (Amazon Web Services)
is currently officially supported, with GCE and OpenStack in beta support, and other platforms planned.

## Can I see it in action?
