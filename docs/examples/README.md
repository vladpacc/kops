# KOPS CASE-USE EXAMPLES AND LABORATORY EXERCISES.

This section of our documentation contains typical use-cases for Kops. We'll cover here from the most basic things to very advanced use cases with a lot of technical detail. You can and will be able to reproduce all exercises (if you first read and understand what we did and why we did it) providing you have access to the proper resources.

All exercises will need you to prepare your base environment (with kops and kubectl). You can see the ["basic requirements"](basic-requirements.md) document that is a common set of procedures for all our exercises. Please note that all the exercises covered here are production-oriented.

Our exercises are divided on "chapters". Each chapter covers a specific use-case for Kops:

- Chapter I: [USING KOPS WITH COREOS - A MULTI-MASTER/MULTI-NODE PRACTICAL EXAMPLE](coreos-kops-tests-multimaster.md).
- Chapter II: [USING KOPS WITH PRIVATE NETWORKING AND A BASTION HOST IN A HIGLY-AVAILABLE SETUP](kops-tests-private-net-bastion-host.md).
- Chapter III: [USING KOPS WITH A ROUTE53 BASED SUBDOMAIN AND SCALING UP THE CLUSTER](kops-test-route53-subdomain.md).
