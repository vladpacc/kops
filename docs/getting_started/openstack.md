# Getting Started with kops on OpenStack


OpenStack support on kops is currently **beta**, which means that OpenStack support is in good shape and could be used for production. However, it is not as rigorously tested as the stable cloud providers and there are some features not supported. In particular, kops tries to support a wide variety of OpenStack setups and not all of them are equally well tested.

## OpenStack requirements

In order to deploy a kops-managed clustr on OpenStack, you need the following OpenStack servces:

* Nova (compute)
* Neutron (networking)
* Glance (image)
* Cinder (block storage)

In addition, kops can make use of the following services:

* Swift (object store)
* Dvelve (dns)
* Octavia (loadbalancer)

The OpenStack version should be Ocata or newer.

## Source your openstack RC
The Cloud Config used by the kubernetes API server and kubelet will be constructed from environment variables in the openstack RC file.

```bash
source openstack.rc
```

We recommend using [Application Credentials](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/queens/user/application_credentials.html) when authenticating to OpenStack.

**Note** The authentication used locally will be exported to your cluster and used by the kubernetes controller components. You must avoid using personal credentials used for other systems, 

## Environment Variables

kops stores its configuration in a state store. Before creating a cluster, we need to export the path to the state store:

```bash
export KOPS_STATE_STORE=swift://<bucket-name> # where <bucket-name> is the name of the Swift container to use for kops state

```

If your OpenStack does not have Swift you can use any other VFS store, such as S3. See the [state store documentation](../state.md) for alternatives.

## Creating a Cluster

```bash
# to see your etcd storage type
openstack volume type list

# coreos (the default) + flannel overlay cluster in Default
kops create cluster \
  --cloud openstack \
  --name my-cluster.k8s.local \
  --state ${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
  --zones nova \
  --network-cidr 10.0.0.0/24 \
  --image <imagename> \
  --master-count=3 \
  --node-count=1 \
  --node-size <flavorname> \
  --master-size <flavorname> \
  --etcd-storage-type <volumetype> \
  --api-loadbalancer-type public \
  --topology private \
  --bastion \
  --ssh-public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
  --networking weave \
  --os-ext-net <externalnetworkname>

# to update a cluster
kops update cluster my-cluster.k8s.local --state ${KOPS_STATE_STORE} --yes

# to delete a cluster
kops delete cluster my-cluster.k8s.local --yes
```

## Optional flags

* `--os-kubelet-ignore-az=true` Nova and Cinder have different availability zones, more information [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#block-storage)
* `--os-octavia=true` If Octavia Loadbalancer api should be used instead of old lbaas v2 api.
* `--os-dns-servers=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` You can define dns servers to be used in your cluster if your openstack setup does not have working dnssetup by default


## Compute and volume zone names does not match
Some of the openstack users do not have compute zones named exactly the same than volume zones. Good example is that there are several compute zones for instance `zone-1`, `zone-2` and `zone-3`. Then there is only one volumezone which is usually called `nova`. By default this is problem in kops, because kops assumes that if you are deploying things to `zone-1` there should be compute and volume zone called `zone-1`.

However, you can still get kops working in your openstack by doing following:

Create cluster using your compute zones:

```bash
kops create cluster \
  --zones zone-1,zone-2,zone-3 \
  ...
```

After you have initialized the configuration you need to edit configuration

```bash
kops edit cluster my-cluster.k8s.local
```

Edit `ignore-volume-az` to `true` and `override-volume-az` according to your cinder az name.

Example (volume zone is called `nova`):

```yaml
spec:
  cloudConfig:
    openstack:
      blockStorage:
        ignore-volume-az: true
        override-volume-az: nova
```

**Finally execute update cluster**

```bash
kops update cluster my-cluster.k8s.local --state ${KOPS_STATE_STORE} --yes
```

Kops should create instances to all three zones, but provision volumes from the same zone.

# Using external cloud controller manager
If you want use [External CCM](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack) in your installation, this section contains instructions what you should do to get it up and running.

Create cluster without `--yes` flag (or modify existing cluster):

```bash
kops edit cluster <cluster>
```

Add following to clusterspec:

```yaml
spec:
  cloudControllerManager: {}
```

Finally

```bash
kops update cluster --name <cluster> --yes
```

# Using OpenStack without lbaas

Some OpenStack installations does not include installation of lbaas component. To launch a cluster without a loadbalancer, run:

```bash
kops create cluster \
  --cloud openstack \
  ... (like usually)
  --api-loadbalancer-type=""
```

In clusters without loadbalancer, the address of a single random master will be added to your kube config. 

# Using existing OpenStack network

You can have kops reuse existing network components instead of provisioning one per cluster. As OpenStack support is still beta, we recommend you take extra care when deleting clusters and ensure that kops do not try to remove any resources not belonging to the cluster.

## Let kops provision new subnets within an existing network

Use an existing network by using `--network <network id>`.

If you are provisioning the cluster from a spec file, add the network ID as follows:

```yaml
spec:
  networkID: <network id>
```


## Use existing networks

Instead of kops creating new subnets for the cluster, you can reuse an existing subnet.

When you create a new cluster, you can specify subnets using the `--subnets` and `--utility-subnets` flags.

## Example

```bash
kops create cluster \
  --cloud openstack \
  --name sharedsub2.k8s.local \
  --state ${KOPS_STATE_STORE} \
  --zones zone-1 \
  --network-cidr 10.1.0.0/16 \
  --image debian-10-160819-devops \
  --master-count=3 \
  --node-count=2 \
  --node-size m1.small \
  --master-size m1.small \
  --etcd-storage-type default \
  --topology private \
  --bastion \
  --networking calico \
  --api-loadbalancer-type public \
  --os-kubelet-ignore-az=true \
  --os-ext-net ext-net \
  --subnets c7d20c0f-df3a-4e5b-842f-f633c182961f \
  --utility-subnets 90871d21-b546-4c4a-a7c9-2337ddf5375f \
  --os-octavia=true --yes
```

# Using with self-signed certificates in OpenStack

Kops can be configured to use insecure mode towards OpenStack. However, this is not recommended as OpenStack cloudprovider in kubernetes does not support it.
If you use insecure flag in kops it might be that the cluster does not work correctly.

```yaml
spec:
  cloudConfig:
    openstack:
      insecureSkipVerify: true
```
